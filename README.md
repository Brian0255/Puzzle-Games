# Games
## 1. Minesweeper
  Just the standard classic game of Minesweeper, where you are trying to uncover every tile in a grid that isn't a "bomb."
  - ### General Rules
    - The game starts when you click on any tile. That tile will never be a bomb.
    - Tiles will either be blank, a bomb, or have a number on them.
    - Tiles with a number on them tell you how many bombs are around it, and blank tiles have none.
    - To win the game, you must carefully deduce which tiles are bombs in order to find every safe tile. 
  - ### Controls
    - Left clicking will reveal the selected tile, as shown below: 

## 2. Battleship
## 3. Fill the Squares
## 4. Block Slide
## 5. Block Fill
## 6. Coordination
