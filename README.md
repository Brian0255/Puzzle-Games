# Games
## 1. Minesweeper <a name="minesweeper"/>
  Just the standard classic game of Minesweeper, where you are trying to uncover every tile in a grid that isn't a "bomb."
  - ### General Rules
    - The game starts when you click on any tile. That tile will never be a bomb.
      
      An example of what a region may look like after you click a tile to start (in this case, the red X was the tile):
      
      ![](/Pictures/minesweeperStartExample.png)
      
    - Tiles will either be blank, a bomb, or have a number on them.
    - Tiles with a number on them tell you how many bombs are around it, and blank tiles have none.
    - To win the game, you must carefully deduce which tiles are bombs in order to find every safe tile. A completed game may look like this, for example:
    
      <img src="/Pictures/minesweeperWinExample.png" width="400">
    
  - ### Controls
    - Left clicking will reveal the selected tile, as shown below: 

      Before revealing: 
      
      ![](/Pictures/minesweeperRevealBefore.png)
      
      After revealing: 
      
      ![](/Pictures/minesweeperRevealAfter.png)
       
    - Right clicking will flag the selected tile as a bomb. Here's an example:

      Before flagging:
      
       ![](/Pictures/minesweeperFlagBefore.png)
      
      After flagging:
      
        ![](/Pictures/minesweeperFlagAfter.png)
        
    - Middle clicking is a nifty tool that will reveal all tiles around a numbered square if all its bombs are flagged. Sound a little confusing? These pictures might help:

       Before middle clicking the "2" tile:
      
       ![](/Pictures/minesweeperShiftClickBefore.png)
      
       After middle clicking the "2" tile:

       ![](/Pictures/minesweeperShiftClickAfter.png)
